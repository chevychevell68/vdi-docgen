# Deliverables

This document lists the standard deliverables recognized by the MVP and how they map to filenames in `output-docx/`.

## Conventional Filenames (DOCX)

- SOW.docx
- HLD.docx
- LLD.docx
- Runbook.docx
- PDG.docx
- LOE-WBS.docx
- ATP.docx
- Adoption_Plan.docx
- LOE.docx
- WBS.docx

> The results page inspects what files actually exist in `output-docx/` and only renders active download buttons for the present files. Requested-but-missing files appear as disabled/“not generated yet.”

## Where They Land

- **Final DOCX** → `output-docx/`
- **ZIP Exports** → `generated/exports/<submit_id>.zip`
- **Authoritative Submission Snapshot** → `submissions/<submit_id>.json`
- **Intermediate Markdown** (if used) → `output/`

## Generation

The system supports a Pandoc-based generation pipeline:
1. Render Jinja + Markdown templates with submission context.
2. Convert Markdown → DOCX via `pandoc`.
3. Write files into `output-docx/` using the conventional names above.

This pipeline is optional: the app will happily link any DOCX that already exists in `output-docx/` even if generated by another tool.
