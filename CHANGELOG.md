## [v1.1.3] – Convert Yes/No Questions to Checkboxes
### Added
- Added dynamic logic that automatically converts “Yes / No” questions into checkboxes.
- When checked, the field submits the value `"Yes"`. When unchecked, no value is sent.
- The checkbox appears before the question text for intuitive UX.

### Maintained
- Required-field asterisks and placeholder logic remain fully functional.
- Behavior applies globally, with no template rewrites needed.

### Deployment
- Commit: `v1.1.3`
- Branch: `v1.1.1` (active dev)
