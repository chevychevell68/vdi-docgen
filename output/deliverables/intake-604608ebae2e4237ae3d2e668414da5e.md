## Voice of the Customer
The Air Force customer has an established SIPR VDI environment that has been in operation for nearly a decade. Last fiscal year, they procured Cisco UCS compute through WWT but selected HPE Electra for the storage component, which was implemented by an internal government team.

Following multiple challenges with the initial rollout across four of the ten planned sites, the customer now seeks WWT’s leadership to assume full responsibility for the remaining six deployments. Their primary goal is to stabilize and modernize the existing VDI infrastructure while leveraging WWT’s proven expertise with integrated compute and storage solutions.

Although the environment currently includes HPE storage—which is outside WWT’s typical flash stack standard—the customer’s priority is to engage a single, accountable partner who can deliver a consistent, enterprise-grade SIPR VDI experience across all locations.

The locations vary in size and configuration but all are about 4-5 nodes per site, with about 200-500 users per location. Another opportunity is moving along in parallel for the General Compute cluster for the Horizon core components. This should be deployed as a VCF cluster, with Cloud Pod Architecture to the other 4 existing sites and the 6 new ones.
